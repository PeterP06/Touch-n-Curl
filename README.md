# Touch-n-Curl

## About Touch-n-Curl

Touch-n-Curl is a design and construction system for rapidly prototyping 3D skeletal curved structures, covering scales from millimeters to meters, by printing 2D zipper assemblies with interlocking mechanisms using conventional 3D printers. This parametric design tool is developed to support this inverse design workflow, instantly generating 2D zippers and offering a preview of the 3D skeletal assembly.

This program is based on Rhino&Grasshoper and exist as a plug-in of Grasshopper. Its input is a skeleton form(curve only for now) and output is zipper pair for 3D-printing. For more information, please refer to our paper:

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A computer compatible with Python 3.8 or higher
- Rhino 8 with Grasshopper (Grasshopper is included by default when installing Rhino)
- Wombat (A plugin for Grasshopper)
  - For Windows or Mac with Intel chips users: Drag the [example file](./Example.gh) into Rhino and follow the on-screen instructions `OR` download from [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/wombatgh)
  - For Mac with Silicon chips users: Download from [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/wombatgh) and move the downloaded folder to a path similar to `/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME./Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/packages/8.0`

### Configuration

1. Download [cluster files](./Touch-n-Curl%20Clusters) into a path similar to `/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME./Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/8.0/Plug-ins/Grasshopper (b45a29b1-4343-4035-989e-044e8580d9cf)/UserObjects`.
2. Restart Rhino and enjoy.
