# Touch-n-Curl

## About Touch-n-Curl

Touch-n-Curl is a design and construction system for rapidly prototyping 3D skeletal curved structures, covering scales from millimeters to meters, by printing 2D zipper assemblies with interlocking mechanisms using conventional 3D printers. This parametric design tool is developed to support this inverse design workflow, instantly generating 2D zippers and offering a preview of the 3D skeletal assembly.

This tool is based on Rhino&Grasshoper and exist as a plug-in of Grasshopper. Its input is a skeleton form(curve only for now) and output is zipper pair for 3D-printing.
